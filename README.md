<p><h2>Part 1: WeatherPy</h1></p>
<p><h3>Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude<h3></p>
<p>Use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities list generated in the started code</p>
<p>Create a scatter plot to showcase the relationship between Latitude vs. Temperature</p>
<p>Create a scatter plot to showcase the relationship between Latitude vs. Humidity</p>
<p>Create a scatter plot to showcase the relationship between Latitude vs. Cloudiness</p>
<p>Create a scatter plot to showcase the relationship between Latitude vs. Wind Speed</p>

<p><h3>Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship</h2><br>
<p>Linear regression scatter plot for Northern Hemisphere: Temperature (C) vs. Latitude</p>
<p>Linear regression scatter plot for Southern Hemisphere: Temperature (C) vs. Latitude</p>
<p>Linear regression scatter plot for Northern Hemisphere: Humidity (%) vs. Latitude</p>
<p>Linear regression scatter plot for Southern Hemisphere: Humidity (%) vs. Latitude</p>
<p>Linear regression scatter plot for Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude</p>
<p>Linear regression scatter plot for Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude</p>
<p>Linear regression scatter plot for Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed (m/s) vs. Latitude</p>
<p>Linear regression scatter plot for Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed (m/s) vs. Latitude</p>

<p><h2></h1>Part 2: VacationPy</h1><br>
<p>Create a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df DataFrame</p>
<p>Narrow down the city_data_df DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition</p>
<p>For each city in the hotel_df DataFrame, use the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 metres of your coordinates</p>
<p>Add the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city in the map.</p>
